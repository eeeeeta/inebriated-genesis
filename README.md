inebriated: the original edition
================================

A long time ago, in an IRC chatroom far, far away...
----------------------------------------------------

This is the **very first** implementation in the inebriated project line.
Conceived in the waning hours before New Years' 2015, and tested and showcased
in the venerable *#freenode-newyears* party channel, it was a crude implementation
of a Markov-chains chatbot, hurrily coded and tweaked for the public's edification.


Now, you, the reader, will get to experience this delight. Such wonderful, tangled code!
Such inelegant beauty!


... It almost crashed a few times, too.

This code is kept refrigerated, left as it was when it was first written. It may or may not
comprise a functional program. Who knows? It remains here only as a relic of its time, a lesson
to be kept in mind when designing other programs of the same purpose.


(I'll probably resurrect it at some point and turn it into something you can play with.)

So this is useless, then.
------------------------

Don't say that!


This code may not be in working order, but the dynasty it has helped inspire still lives,
following in its barely-functional, buggy footsteps. Links:
